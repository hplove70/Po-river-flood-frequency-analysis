# Po-river-flood-frequency-analysis

Using PCR-GLOBWB 2 a hydrological model to simulate and produce daily river flow for the years between 2000 and 2010 based on daily meteorological observations.

Then assesing the expected flood risk and estimate the magnitude and frequency of extreme flood events in Po river basin using Gumble distribution function. 

These data ( simulated river floods) are evaluated and compared with real river discharge observations and the plots are made to show the fit between simualted data and the real observations.
